## 📝 AFTER DEPLOYMENT

Once your site is live, you can:

1. **Test login on live site**
2. **Create articles** (they'll be temporary until you add database)
3. **Share your URL** with anyone!
4. **Later: Add database** (optional, for persistent data)

---

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: Your Site Works WITHOUT Database!

I've configured everything to use **mock data** so you can deploy immediately without setting up Supabase or any database. This means:

- ✅ Everything works
- ✅ Fast deployment
- ✅ No database setup needed
- ✅ Login works
- ✅ Admin panel works

When you're ready for a full production site with real data storage, you can add Supabase later.

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If login doesn't work locally:
1. Refresh: http://localhost:3001/admin/login
2. Clear cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Try different browser

### If deployment fails:
1. Make sure environment variable is added
2. Check build logs in Vercel
3. Repo is public and accessible
